### **Support Mails Classification Project-(Oct-2023)** 
 - Utilizing the Imap-tools Python module, this project involves logging into a support mailbox, downloading emails, and extracting attachments. The emails will be classified into four categories based on their subjects.
 - The classified emails will then be organized into their respective categories, and automatic forwarding and replies will be implemented.

### **Claims Scheme Performance Web application-(Dec-2021)** 
 - Using Plotly, Dash, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to make interactive visualizations and create dashboard as web application with a REST API as a data source, performed data wrangling with Pandas, and deployed web application on a cloud server.
 - Libraries Used: Plotly, Dash, matplotlib, seaborn

### **Implementing Face Recognition for Member Authentication process-(Sept-2023)** 
 - FastAPI used to build APIs for registering member faces and conducting authentication checks. 
 - MediaPipe employed for face detection, and the face-recognition module utilized for face Recognition.

### **Create a Windows Desktop App for Automation-(May-2023)** 
 - Created application for quick task automation. Developed an application to pattern-based file path retrieval, copying files to specified destinations from an Excel reference. Integrated PySimpleGUI for an attractive GUI and used pyinstaller module for creating a desktop executable.
